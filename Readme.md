# CoMW

Comparative Metatranscriptomics Workflow is a standardized and validated workflow to functionally classify quality filtered mRNA reads from metatranscriptomic or total RNA studies generated using NGS short reads. CoMW is used for classification of these reads using assembled contigs to the reference databases provided and cited. 

If you use CoMW in your research, please cite:

1. Download the development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/currocam/CoMW
```

Run install.sh file to download databases to be used in CoMW in databases directory
```bash
bash ./install.sh
```

## Scripts

These scripts are written in Python and detailed parameters and dependdencies are along with usage examples are given in CoMW user manual CoMW_Manual.pdf

```bash

1. assemble_reads.py
2. filter_ncRNAs.py
3. map_reads_to_contigs.py
4. filter_table_by_abundance.py
5. align_contigs_to_database.py
6. parse_sword.py
7. map_orthologs_to_count_table.py
8. annotate_count_table.py

```

## Utils

Utils are small snippets written in R or bash to assist main scripts.
They must be present in utils folder in order to be accessible


## Databases 

Databases include fasta files and annotations that are also available in their respective developer websites but are also collected here under same licence Depending upon your usage, please cite the efforts of these databases that were developed by these groups.
